|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fields`      | `str`        | The fields parameter allows you to select which field(s) should be included. If desired fields are not specified, all fields will be returned. When a file name passed to the fields parameter is not available for the endpoint accessed, an error will occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `filter`      | `str`        | Filters are used to view a subset of the data based on specific criteria. For example, you may want to find data that falls within a certain date range, or only show records which contain a value larger than a certain threshold.  Use a colon at the end of a filter parameter to pass a value or list of values. For lists passed as filter criteria, use a comma-separated list within parentheses. Filter for specific dates using the format YYYY-MM-DD. When no filters are provided, the default response will return all fields and all data. |
| `sort`        | `str`        | The sort parameter allows a user to sort a field in ascending (least to greatest) or descending (greatest to least) order. The sort parameter accepts a comma-separated list of field names. When no sort parameter is specified, the default is to sort by the first column listed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `page_size`   | `str or int` | The page size will set the number of rows that are returned on a request. When no page size parameter is specified, the default response is 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `page_number` | `str or int` | The page number will set the index for the pagination, starting at 1. When no page number is specified, the default response is 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Returns
- pd.DataFrame: Dataframe containing the FiscalData endpoint table data.


### info_fiscaldata
Get information of a FiscalData table.

```python
from fiscaldataapi import info_fiscaldata
df = info_fiscaldata(database)
```

#### Parameters
| Parameter  | Type  | Description                |
|------------|-------|----------------------------|
| `database` | `str` | Table name of the endpoint |

#### Returns
- tuple(dict, int, int): Dictionary with the format of the table columns, the number of pages of table data (each page has up to 100 rows) and number of total rows of table data.

The premise of the reconciliation is that transaction data is shared between the accrual and budgetary cash accounting basis.

The most significant assets that are reported on the balance sheets are loans receivable; property, plant, and equipment; inventories and related property; and cash or other monetary assets. The most significant liabilities reported on the balance sheets are federal debt securities held by the public and accrued interest, and federal employee and veteran benefits payable. The net position is the residual difference between assets and liabilities and is the cumulative results of operations since inception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
